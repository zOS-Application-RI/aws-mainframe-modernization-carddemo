## Description
Card Demo is a Mainframe application designed and developed to test and showcase AWS and partner technology for mainframe migration and modernization use-cases such as discovery, migration, modernization, performance test, augmentation, service enablement, service extraction, test creation, test harness, etc.

Note that the intent of this application is to provide mainframe coding scenarios to exercise analysis, transformation and migration tooling. So, the coding style is not uniform across the application

<br/>

## Technologies used
1. COBOL
2. CICS
3. VSAM
4. JCL
5. RACF

<br/>

## Installation on the mainframe 

To install this repository on the mainframe please follow the following steps

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment

2. Create datasets on the mainframe  hold the code
   * It is recommended to group them under a High Level Qualifier (HLQ)for all your datasets. 
   * Upload the following application source folders from the main branch of git repository on to your mainframe
      using $INDFILE or your preferred upload tool.
   * If you have used AWS.M2 as your HLQ, you should end up with the below code structure on the mainframe
   
      | HLQ    | Name          | Format | Length |
      | :----- | :------------ | :----- | -----: |
      | AWS.M2 | CARDDEMO.JCL  | FB     |     80 |
      | AWS.M2 | CARDDEMO.PROC | FB     |     80 |
      | AWS.M2 | CARDDEMO.CBL  | FB     |     80 |

3. Use data for testing using either of the below approaches

   ** Use the supplied sample data**
   
      * Upload the sample data provided in the main/-/data/EBCDIC/ folder to the mainframe. Ensure that you use transfer mode binary

4. Compile the Programs. 
   
   You should use the compile process followed by your mainframe shopfloor
   
   We have however provided some sample JCLs in UTIL folders in git to help you craft the JCL
   

5. Create resources in the CARDDEMO group in CICS
   
   You have 2 options
   
   Be sure to edit the HLQs in the below documents as required before you do the definition
   
   * (Preferred) . Use the DFHCSDUP JCL that the resources required by the application

      The resources required are in the CSD file provided in the CSD folder
       
      * Group CARDDEMO
      * Mapsets
      * Transactions
      * Maps
      * Files
      
   * Use the CEDA transaction to execute the commands in the above listing
   
      * Define group 
         ```shell
         DEFINE LIBRARY(COM2DOLL) GROUP(CARDDEMO) DSNAME01(&HLQ..LOADLIB)
         ```
      * Define Mapsets, Maps , Programs and Files
      
         Sample CEDA commands
         
         ```shell
         DEF PROGRAM(COCRDLIC) GROUP(CARDDEMO)
         DEF MAPSET(COCRDLI) GROUP(CARDDEMO)
         DEFINE PROGRAM(COSGN00C) GROUP(CARDDEMO) DA(ANY) TRANSID(CC00) DESCRIPTION(LOGIN)
         DEFINE TRANSACTION(CC00) GROUP(CARDDEMO) PROGRAM(COSGN00C) TASKDATAL(ANY)
         ```

   * Install /Load the online resources to your CICS region

      ```shell
      CEDA INSTALL TRANS(CCLI) GROUP(CARDDEMO)
      CEDA INSTALL FILE(CARDDAT) GROUP(CARDDEMO)
      CECI LOAD PROG(COCRDUP)
      CECI LOAD PROG(COCRDUPC)
      ```

   * Execute a NEWCOPY of mapsets and maps
      ```shell
      CEMT SET PROG(COCRDUP) NEWCOPY
      CEMT SET PROG(COCRDUPC) NEWCOPY  
      ```
6. Enjoy the demo

   * For online functions : Start the credit card demo application using the CC00 transaction
   * For running batch    : Use the JCLs described in the JCL dataset

## Running full batch 
   
  * Execute the following JCLs in order

## Application Details 
The CardDemo is a Credit Card management application, built primarily using COBOL programming language. The application has various functions that allow users to manage Account, Credit card, Transaction and Bill payment. 

There are 2 types of users:
* Regular User
* Admin User

The Regular user can perform the user functions and the Admin users can only perform Admin functions.
